Git Basics for Beginners

This file explains how to use Git to track and save changes in a project.

Basic Workflow

1. Check the status of your repository
   git status: This shows which files have been changed or added.

2. Stage changes
   git add <filename>: This prepares your changes to be committed.

3. Commit changes
   git commit -m "Add a meaningful message": Commits save your staged changes
   to the local repository with a message explaining what changed.

4. Push changes to a remote repository
   git push

5. Pull requests 
   git pull: Pull requests are proposals to merge code changes into a project.
